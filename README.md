Hi There :v:,

In this Grind Series you'll see me
1. Solving atleast one problem on Leetcode or Hackerrank
2. How I spend my entire day
3. UpSkilling myself in data engineering tools and concepts
4. Solving a complex SQL question daily with clear explanations provided
   
To prove my authenticity, just check the dates on the screenshots attached in the docs.
Will also be uploading all the notes I've prepared while learning data engineering
in a separate folder.

Started leetcoding from feb6th 2024
Leetcode : https://leetcode.com/OnlyGrind/
Hackerrank : https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/kaushikvarman


The reason why i started this series is to show you guys how i am
improving myself day by day.
I work harder. I push myself everyday and refuse to let any obstacle stand in my way.
I wont rest until i get a job.
I'll make this comeback very personal.
